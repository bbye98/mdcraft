It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efﬁcient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common ﬁle formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM’s powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X. It is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com.},

	abstract = {Polyelectrolytes are commonly used to chelate multivalent ions in aqueous solutions, playing a critical role in water softening and the prevention of mineralization. At sufficient ionic strength, ion-mediated polyelectrolyte–polyelectrolyte interactions can precipitate polyelectrolyte–ion complexes, a phenomenon known as “like-charge attraction”. While the significant influence of small ions on polyelectrolyte solution phase behavior is recognized, the precise molecular mechanisms driving the counterintuitive phenomenon remain largely elusive. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanism of like-charge attraction between two poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) chains in solution. We find that moderate quantities of Ca2+ ions induce attraction between PAA chains, facilitated by the formation of PAA–Ca2+–PAA bridges and a significant increase in the coordination of Ca2+ ions by the PAA chains. At high Ca2+ number densities, ion bridges are disfavored due to electrostatic screening, yet the chains are still attracted to each other due to solvent-mediated interactions between the chains and their chelated ions. The insights gleaned from this study not only enrich our understanding of the intricate mechanism of like-charge attraction between polyanions in solution but also illuminate the influence of multivalent ions on polyelectrolyte interactions.},

	abstract = {Polyelectrolytes, such as poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), can effectively mitigate CaCO3 scale formation. Despite their success as antiscalants, the underlying mechanism of binding of Ca2+ to polyelectrolyte chains remains unresolved. Through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we constructed an adsorption isotherm of Ca2+ binding to sodium polyacrylate (NaPAA) and investigated the associated binding mechanism. We find that the number of calcium ions adsorbed [Ca2+]ads to the polymer saturates at moderately high concentrations of free calcium ions [Ca2+]aq in the solution. This saturation value is intricately connected with the binding modes accessible to Ca2+ ions when they bind to the polyelectrolyte chain. We identify two dominant binding modes: the first involves binding to at most two carboxylate oxygens on a polyacrylate chain, and the second, termed the high binding mode, involves binding to four or more carboxylate oxygens. As the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca2+]aq increases from low to moderate levels, the polyelectrolyte chain undergoes a conformational transition from an extended coil to a hairpin-like structure, enhancing the accessibility to the high binding mode. At moderate concentrations of [Ca2+]aq, the high binding mode accounts for at least one-third of all binding events. The chain’s conformational change and its consequent access to the high binding mode are found to increase the overall Ca2+ ion binding capacity of the polyelectrolyte chain.},
