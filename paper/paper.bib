The new implementation extends the functionality of the original version, provides a much more convenient user interface (both graphical/interactive and batch), and can be used as a tool set for implementing new analysis modules. This was made possible by the use of a high-level language, Python, and of modern object-oriented programming techniques. The quantities that can be calculated by nMoldyn are the mean-square displacement, the velocity autocorrelation function as well as its Fourier transform (the density of states) and its memory function, the angular velocity autocorrelation function and its Fourier transform, the reorientational correlation function, and several functions specific to neutron scattering: the coherent and incoherent intermediate scattering functions with their Fourier transforms, the memory function of the coherent scattering function, and the elastic incoherent structure factor. The possibility to compute memory function is a new and powerful feature that allows to relate simulation results to theoretical studies.},

  abstract = {The simple theory of resistivity originally applied to pure liquid metals (Ziman 1961, Bradley et al. 1962) is formally extended to liquid alloys. In dilute solutions, size difference between solute and solvent ions can be allowed for, approximately, by a modification of the pseudo-potential of the solute, in a manner reminiscent of the modification of solute valency suggested by Harrison and Blatt (1957) in dealing with the resistance of solid alloys. The theory explains qualitatively a number of interesting features of the behaviour of liquid binary alloys, e.g. the failure of liquid solutions in polyvalent metals to obey the familiar rules of Nordheim and Linde. Some speculations on the anomalous behaviour of mercury amalgams are included. A bibliography of experimental results for both resistivity and density in liquid alloys is collected in Appendix II.}
