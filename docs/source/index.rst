   MDCraft is a Python assistant for performing and analyzing molecular dynamics simulations of soft matter systems. It is designed to provide comprehensive support throughout the entire simulation process, from initialization to post-processing. 

   Being tightly integrated with OpenMM, a relatively new simulation toolkit that has seen a surge in popularity in recent years due to its class-leading performance and flexibility through support for custom intermolecular forces and integrators for equations of motion. Due to its age and design philosophy, OpenMM offers comparatively fewer choices of pair potentials and external forces, and no on-the-fly analysis support. MDCraft fills this gap in two ways. First, the `openmm` module leverages the modularity of OpenMM to provide a suite of custom force fields, problem-solving tools, trajectory readers and writers, and utility functions for unit reduction, topology transformations, and performance optimizations that are not typically available in other simulation packages. Then, the classes in the `analysis` module enable computing common structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties using the topology, trajectory, and state data generated by OpenMM (or other simulation packages).

   The `analysis` module also stands out due to the remarkable flexibility it affords its end users. General users have unprecedented control over what aspects of the properties to calculate and which method to employ through a plethora of well-documented built-in options in each analysis class, without having to be concerned about the underlying implementations. More advanced users, on the other hand, have the option to work directly with the algorithms in the `algorithms` module for further customization.

   The application of MDCraft extends across various domains within computational chemistry and materials science. Researchers can utilize it to study the low-level mechanisms involved in supercapacitors, polymer gels, drug delivery systems, and nanomaterial synthesis, thus highlighting its versatility and broad applicability in cutting-edge scientific research.
